PROBLEM STATEMENT
● Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the most common serious illnesses 
affecting human health which can be harmful or even fatal. 
● The likelihood of survival can be increased and the mortality rate could be 
decreased by early diagnosis, which may allow for CVD mitigation and 
treatment. 
● A powerful machine learning (ML) technique that can help medical professionals 
during a patient’s diagnosis procedure
DATASET 
● There are five different datasets: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, VA Long Beach and 
Statlog heart disease dataset
● More than 1190 cases are collected as a text file along with 14 special features from their 
database.
● 13 attributes of these combined datasets are taken as diagnosis inputs. ‘num’ attribute is 
selected as output.
● Six features which are considered relevant in medical literature were present in all or most 
records: age in years (age), sex(sex), resting blood pressure (trestbps), fasting blood 
sugar(fbs), chest pain type (cp), and resting electrocardiographic results (restecg).
Novelty
The objective of this study is to create an efficient system for accurately predicting heart illness, 
specifically Coronary Artery Disease or Coronary Heart Disease.
1) A larger and more reliable dataset is created by combining five datasets.
2) Based on rank values in medical references, the essential features are extracted using two 
selection algorithms, Relief, and LASSO. Also, this aids in solving the machine learning overfitting 
and underfitting issues.
3) Moreover, a number of hybrid strategies, such as Boosting and Bagging, are used to increase 
the testing rate and decrease execution time.
4) On the basis of the overall findings with All, Relief, and LASSO selected features, the 
performance of the various models is examined.
